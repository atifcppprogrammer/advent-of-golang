# Development Setup

## Requirements and Initial Setup
To work with this repository, your system should be provisioned with the [latest version](https://go.dev/doc/install) 
of Golang and the [GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) tool. With those
requirements met and the repository cloned please be sure to run the following 
command in the repository's root to complete the initial setup.
```
make
```

## Makefile Targets
The `Makefile` in the repository's root provides targets for automating certain
mundane actions. A brief explanation for each such target is provided below.

### `setup`
This target sets up the git hooks provided in the `.git-hooks` directory and makes
all the shell scripts present in the `scripts` directory executable. Omitting `setup` 
and just running `make` as in "Requirements and Initial Setup" section above ðŸ‘†,
results in the same behaviour.
```
make setup
```

### `init`
This target creates a [Go module](https://go.dev/blog/using-go-modules) for a single
puzzle's solution. Suppose we are attempting to solve the ["Calorie Counting"](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/1)
which is the puzzle for day 1 of the year 2022. The following command will create
said Go module with some starter code, and include it in the `go.work` file.
```
make init YEAR=2022 DAY=1 NAME="Calorie Counting" 
```

### `run`
This target will run your solution against the input provided by Advent of Code for
the puzzle in question, for the "Calorie Counting" puzzle mentioned above ðŸ‘† this 
target will be invoked as follows.
```
make run YEAR=2022 DAY=1 INPUT="./path/to/adventofcode/puzzle/input.txt"
```

If the puzzle in question has multiple parts and you wish to execute the solution 
for a specific part then this can be done in the following manner. We assume that
the `SolutionPart` variable exposed by the `utilities` package (which corresponds
to the provide `PART` argument), is used in the solution code to account for the
different parts.
```
make run YEAR=2022 DAY=1 PART=2 INPUT="./path/to/adventofcode/puzzle/input.txt"
```

### `test`
This target will run all provided unit tests for all puzzle solutions and the Go 
modules in `packages` directory.
```
make test
```

### `format`
This target will format your source code using the `gofmt` tool, normally you would
not need to run this as a git hook is in place to format your code before committing.
```
make format
```

### `version`
This target is intended for setting the `Go` version for all packages and solution
modules to the latest version, this target is _not_ intended for use by contributors. 
The repository owner is reponsible for bumping all `Go` modules to the latest version.
```
make version GO=1.21.4
```

### `solution`
This target will commit your solution with a pre-defined commit message, this will
ensure that all commits carrying a solution follow a consistent pattern, keeping 
with the "Calorie Counting" example the following command will create the commit 
message `solution: year-2022/day-01`.
```
make solution YEAR=2022 DAY=1
```

### `improve`
This target will open your git editor with a pre-existing commit template for 
commiting improvements you have made to a **single** solution, keeping with the
"Calorie Counting" example the following command
```
make improve YEAR=2022 DAY=1
```

will open the configured editor with the following message, please provide each
improvement you make as a single bullet point.
```
improvement: year-2022/day-01

# please explain what improvements you made
- improvement-1
- improvement-2
- improvement-3
- etc.
```
